# House-Price-Prediction

This is one of the Kaggle competitions to predict the sales price for each house. 
For each Id in the test set, the SalePrice is predicted and then it will be evaluated on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 
between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price.
In this experiment, in order to get the best model, there are  5 different machine learning methods that will be applied. 
The five different methods are Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, 
Decision Tree and Random Forest.
